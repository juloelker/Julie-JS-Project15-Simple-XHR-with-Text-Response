# Julie-JS-Project15-Simple-XHR-with-Text-Response

This is a simple exercise in asynchronous processing in Javascript.  It's a http request with response text.  Note that for testing purposes, I had to run Chrome with 2 additional commands:

--allow-file-access-from-files --disable-web-security

This is to allow server requests on my local machine.  Without it, we get CORS violations, a "new" security feature for http requests.
